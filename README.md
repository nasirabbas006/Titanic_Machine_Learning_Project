This project analyzes the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival using a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) for logistic regression. The model identifies key factors influencing survival and provides probabilities for each passenger's survival based on their features.

Project Overview:

The Titanic dataset contains detailed information about the passengers onboard the Titanic, such as demographic information, ticket class, and survival status. This project builds a logistic regression model to predict whether a passenger survived the disaster (Survived = 1) or not (Survived = 0).

Key highlights of the project:

Preprocessing of the dataset, including handling missing values and feature encoding.
Implementation of a GLM logistic regression model using the Statsmodels library.
Evaluation of model performance and insights derived from feature importance.
